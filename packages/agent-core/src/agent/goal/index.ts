 * | `paused`   | yes       | yes       | pauseGoal / pauseActiveGoal /   | User, interrupt, resume, or retryable runtime    |
 * |            |           |           | pauseOnInterrupt /              | stop parked it; intact.                          |

 * thing — "the driver is not running continuation turns, but the goal is intact
 * and resumable via `/goal resume`" — differing only in *who* stopped it (the
 * user vs the system) and the human-readable `reason`. There is no separate
 * `impossible`, `budget_limited`, `error`, or `cancelled` status: an
 * unachievable goal or an exhausted budget becomes `blocked(+reason)`,
