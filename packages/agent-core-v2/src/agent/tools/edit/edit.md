Perform exact replacements in existing files.

- Drop the line-number prefix and tab; match only file content.
- `old_string` must be unique unless `replace_all` is set.
- If `old_string` is ambiguous, add surrounding context.
- Multiple Edit calls may run in one response only when they do not target the same file.
- DO NOT issue consecutive Edit calls on the same file. A previous Edit can invalidate a later Edit's `old_string`, causing `old_string not found`. Read the file again before the next Edit.
