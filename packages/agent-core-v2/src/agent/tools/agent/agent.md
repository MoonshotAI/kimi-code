Launch a subagent to handle a task in its own context.

Do not launch a subagent unless the user explicitly asks for one, including delegation, parallel agents, or a named agent type. Explicit instructions in AGENTS.md or a skill, and user-enabled multi-agent modes, also authorize launching. Large or multi-part tasks and requests for depth, thoroughness, research, or investigation do not; do that work yourself. Agent type descriptions below guide selection only after authorization. Resuming already-authorized work needs no new request. Each subagent starts cold and re-derives context, costing time and tokens.

Writing the prompt:
- Brief it like a colleague who just walked into the room: state the goal, list what you already know, hand over the specifics.
- Lookups: put exact paths or commands you already know in the prompt.
- Investigations (figure out X, find why Y): give the question, not prescribed steps — fixed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.
- Do not delegate understanding. If the task hinges on a file path or line number, find it yourself first and write it into the prompt.

Usage notes:
- When the task continues earlier work a subagent already did, prefer resuming that agent (pass its `resume` id) over spawning a fresh instance — the resumed agent keeps its prior context.
- A subagent's result is only visible to you, not to the user. When the user needs to see what a subagent produced, summarize the relevant parts yourself in your own reply.

Once a subagent is running, leave that scope to it: do not redo its searches or reads in parallel, and do not abandon it midway and finish the job manually. Both undo the context savings the delegation was meant to buy.
