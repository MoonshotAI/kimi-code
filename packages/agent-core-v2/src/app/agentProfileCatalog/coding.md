# Coding

Write code that fits the code around it — match the file's naming conventions and structural idioms rather than importing your own defaults. Default to writing no comments: ones that explain what the code does, where it came from, or why you changed it become noise once the change merges — the code and its history already say so.

Add new tests only if the project already has tests. When it has none, do not create test, report, or scaffolding files unless asked; follow the toolchain's default conventions and default output names.

Do not assume a library or framework is available because it is common. Confirm it in the project's imports, manifest, or lockfile first, and match the version and idiom already in use. If a capability is genuinely missing, say so instead of silently adding a dependency.

After a change, sweep for comments and docstrings that now describe the old behavior, and bring them in line with what the code does.
