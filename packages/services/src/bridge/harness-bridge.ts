/**
 * `HarnessBridge` — the in-process RPC bridge owned by the services package.
 * Internally:
 *
 *   1. `createRPC<CoreAPI, SDKAPI>()` produces a `[coreRpc, sdkRpc]` pair of
 *      `RPCClient` functions (packages/agent-core/src/rpc/client.ts:31-103).
 *   2. `new KimiCore(coreRpc, options)` — the core is constructed with the
 *      core-side RPC client (it calls into the SDK side over `coreRpc`).
 *   3. `sdkRpc(new BridgeClientAPI({ ... }))` — the SDK side of the pair is
 *      satisfied by a `BridgeClientAPI` instance whose `SDKAPI` methods route
 *      to DI-resolved brokers. Returns `Promise<RPCMethods<CoreAPI>>` — the
 *      core RPC methods that future positive services (W4+/Phase 1) will use.
 *
 * The result is wrapped in a small `SDKRpcClient`-shaped facade so that
 * service impls (Chain 1+) get the same ergonomics as `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk`
 * (`SDKRpcClientBase` subclass). The facade is exposed as `rpc` for in-package
 * consumers; the public package barrel does NOT re-export `SDKRpcClientBase`,
 * so daemon-side code stays one abstraction layer away.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - `ready()` resolves when both the `KimiCore` plugin/config load AND the
 *     SDK-side RPC binding have settled. Construction is eager (Singleton
 *     pattern); awaiting `ready()` is the safe gate before issuing RPC calls.
 *   - `dispose()` is idempotent. It flips an internal flag so future `rpc`
 *     method dispatch throws before reaching `KimiCore`, then walks the
 *     `Disposable` child stack. `KimiCore` itself has no `dispose()` today —
 *     when it gets one (PLAN Stage 2), we wire it here.
