Add a unified, agent-granular transcript rendering data layer and serve it from the v2 server: clients can fetch turn-paginated transcripts via `GET /sessions/{id}/transcript` and subscribe to per-agent transcript updates over the v1 WebSocket with per-connection granularity control (off / turn / block / delta). All transcript wire types are owned by the transcript package itself.
